Make your bets for week <%= @week.number %> (<%= @week.friday %>)!
=====================

To do so go to <%= new_bet_url %>

If you have a default bet set up, that will be used by default, but you are
free to change it. (Yes, this is for you Miguel, hopefully no one else will use
default bets, because it's a bit lame...).


Thanks for being so deligent!
